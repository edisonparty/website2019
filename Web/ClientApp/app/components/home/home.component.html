                    The venue Eggeby Gård features a converted barn named Teaterladan with plenty of space, an open field for camping, free parking and the Stockholm
                    metro system nearby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a perfect place to experience the Swedish summer, meeting other sceners outside in the warm sun or working on your production
                    inside the barn while it rains.

                    Please note that SJ is doing track maintenance between Stockholm Central and Stockholm Södra
                    during the party. If your travel plan involve those tracks you'll have to switch between SL commute
                    trains at Flemingsberg or Stockholm Södra. Please

                        <p>
                            When travelling by plane we recommend the Arlanda or Bromma airports. Taxi directly from Arlanda to
                            the party shouldn't be more than around 550 SEK, so if you are a group of people that's recommended.

                        <p>
                            From Stockholm Central Station there it's a matter of either taking a cab or going by
                            the metro. If you want to go by metro, the closest stop is Tensta on the blue line, and from there it's a
                            1.5 kilometer walk to the party. A more scenic but longer walk can be enjoyed walking from Kista, also the blue line.
                        </p>

                            Going by taxi from Stockholm Central Station is easy if you use the designated taxi area outside.
                            The cabs there are regulated and won't charge any exuberant fees. It is located in the
                            front of the building.

                        <p>
                            The map below gives some hints. From the E18, take the exit at either Tensta (heading west) or Hjulsta
                            (heading east) and get on Hjulstavägen heading east. Then turn right onto Spånga Kyrkväg in Tensta 
                            and immediately turn left at the gas station and follow Krällingegränd, going under the E18. You'll
                            see Eggeby Gård from here on.
